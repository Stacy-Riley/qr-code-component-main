## My process

I began by building the HTML structure, adding the image, and the written
content. Then in CSS I gave the divs their specific colors and size based on the design. I used Flexbox to center the app on the screen and also the 
contents within the app container. I added the font sizes, line spacing, and letter spacing.  Lastly, I adjusted the margins and padding  so the words and images matched the design mock up as close as possible. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had difficulty placing the figure tag at the top edge so the spacing was 16px. I used a negative margin on the top to pull the image up and made adjustments to the lower elements to keep the right spacing. I am proud 
of the way it turned out.

```css
figure {
    height: 288px;
    width: 288px;
    margin: 0; 
    margin-top: -6px; 
}
```
